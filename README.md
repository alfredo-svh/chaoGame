# chaoGame

NOTICE: This project has remained incomplete as I make a full 3D game from this idea using Unreal Engine.


Chao Game is a command-line virtual pet video game based on the chaos from Sonic Adventure 2: Battle.

List of actions:

1. name/rename your chao
2. go to the doctor
3. pet the chao
4. fight in a karate tournament

**Game is still under development and the list of actions, as well as UX will be continually updated.

**Game developed for Linux command line

**To install and play the game type the following commands:

```
make
./playChao
```
